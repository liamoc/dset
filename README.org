* ~DSet~

This library provides a simple formalisation of (small, decidable) sets in Agda, along with a set of useful lemmas and a 
notion of set equivalence, and equational reasoning tools.

The library itself provides examples of its use, for example in the definitions of ~âˆ©-absorb~ and similar.
